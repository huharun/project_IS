# üõ°Ô∏è Detecting Phishing Websites Using Machine Learning

This is a solo academic project by Arun Thangapalam for CSC 5800 ‚Äì Intelligent Systems. The project focuses on detecting phishing websites using various machine learning algorithms applied to structured URL and domain metadata.

> Phishing is not just a nuisance ‚Äî it‚Äôs a multi-billion dollar cybercrime. This project proves that classic ML still packs a punch in the fight against fakes.

## üìä Project Overview

- Applied **11 different ML algorithms** to classify phishing vs. legitimate websites.
- Used a Kaggle dataset with **95,000+ records** and 10 numerical features.
- Conducted full **EDA, model training, evaluation, and visualization**.
- Ensemble models like **XGBoost**, **Random Forest**, and **AdaBoost** hit **>95% accuracy**.
- Visualized results with confusion matrices, ROC curves, feature importance, and decision tree plots.
